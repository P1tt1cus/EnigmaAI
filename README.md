# EnigmaAI

Author: **Pitticus**

This is just my attempt at writing a RE plugin to assist with reverse engineering with the help of local models.

## Initial Functionality

- Provides a chat window that maintains context of the current function using the high-level il.
- Maintains context of the conversation within the same chat window.
- Can rename variables and function names based on it analysis of the high-evel il.
- Can modify the model and server.

## Goals 

- PydanticAI refactor for improved model interactions.

## License

This plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).
